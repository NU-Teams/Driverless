So At the Time this code was uploded Forces PRO had released version 4.4 but i was unable to download that version so i have no way of testing if mpc code run (IT SHOULD)

to test these scripts

you can run any of these scripts

PathTrackingOne.m
PathTrackingTwo.m
optimalPathTracking.m

all of these scripts should run the included handling track.
to switch tracks uncomment the particular track desired.

for the optimal path script the python script globalracetracktrajectory was used the desired path is given in traj_race_cl.csv

included are some videos showing what should be happening
